- location: Outside the Lodge
- direction: A long, silver weather balloon has brought its payload to earth by the
    edge of a lake, and a man carrying a shotgun finds it. Meanwhile, a Land Rover
    comes over the bridge at the entrance to the Minsbridge Wild Life Sanctuary and
    heads for the warden's lodge. A woman comes out to meet it.
- character: MRS OLLIS
  line: Doctor Tyler, is it?
- character: TYLER
  line: Yeah. Sorry to be a trouble. Thanks very much for calling.
- character: MRS OLLIS
  line: Arthur's keeping an eye on it, down by the lake. He hasn't touched it.
- character: TYLER
  line: Oh good.
- character: MRS OLLIS
  line: It's not chemicals, is it? Only the birds, you see.
- character: TYLER
  line: No, you'll be all right. Nothing to worry about.
- location: Lake side
- direction: The orange payload is clearly marked with Doctor Tyler's name and contact
    details at Wessex University, and the word Reward in three languages. As the Land
    Rover drives round the side of the lake towards Arthur Ollis, the box starts make
    a crackling sound. There is a flash, and Ollis vanishes. The birds take off from
    the lake in fright. Tyler arrives and looks around for Ollis.
- character: TYLER
  line: Mister Ollis! Mister Ollis?
- direction: Tyler goes back to his Land Rover and gets on the radio.
- character: TYLER
  line: Put me through to UNIT HQ will you, please?
- location: UNIT Laboratory
- direction: Jo brings in a tray of drinks.
- character: TYLER
  line: So there you are. Mrs Ollis says her husband's down there, I see him wave,
    get there and there he is, gone. So I got in touch with you lot.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Well quite right too. That's what we're here for, eh, Doctor?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes of course.
- character: JO
  line: What exactly is this machine for?
- character: TYLER
  line: Cosmic Ray Research, Miss Grant.
- character: JO
  line: And you still use balloons?
- character: TYLER
  line: That's right. We may not be NASA, but we get the results. Inside that is the
    most sophisticated Cosmic Ray Monitoring device between here and Cape Kennedy.
    You see, I was going to get in touch with you people anyway, even before this
    business.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Oh? Why was that?
- character: TYLER
  line: Can you give me that briefcase, please?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, of course.
- character: TYLER
  line: Well, we've been getting some pretty funny results on these latest tests.
    Now this is the first one you see. Ah, this is normal.
- direction: Tyler hands the Doctor an x-ray picture.
- character: TYLER
  line: Now then, this is why I'm here. Last week's test. Now, look at that.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Thank you. Good grief.
- direction: The second image is very narrow compared to the first.
- character: TYLER
  line: Yeah. Nobody knows what to make of it. Well, they've all seen it. Yanks, and
    the other lot.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Oh?
- character: TYLER
  line: Now here somewhere, oh yes. Now this is what really put the tin hat on it.
    From that deep space monitor Houston put up. Just take a look at those readings.
- direction: Tyler shows a large printout to the Brigadier.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Er, the Doctor's the
- character: TYLER
  line: What?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: The Doctor's the man you
- character: TYLER
  line: Oh, I see.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Thank you. Well, it's travelling faster than light.
- character: TYLER
  line: Yes. And it can't, can it. I don't know what to make of it. It's come all
    that way, through millions of star systems. It must have been directed, and it
    must have been directed at us. Now why?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Why indeed, Professor Tyler, why indeed.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Thing is, Doctor, is there anything I can do?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes. Pass me a silicon rod will you?
- direction: The rod is passed from the Brigadier to Tyler to Jo to the Doctor, who
    stirs his drink with it.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Yes, what I meant was, is there anything that UNIT can do about this space
    lightning business?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Lightning? Yes, I suppose it could look like lightning, only it isn't. No.
    If there where such a thing I would say it was compressed light. A sort of controlled
    superlucent emission.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: A what?
- character: JO
  line: He means it travels faster than light.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Thank you, Miss Grant.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Tell me, Professor, is this machine of yours functioning properly?
- character: TYLER
  line: Far as I can tell. Haven't developed that latest plate yet, of course.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Then I suggest that you do so immediately and let me know the result of your
    findings. Jo, you and I are going to take a look at the scene of the crime.
- character: JO
  line: Right.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: I think you'll find everything you need here.
- character: TYLER
  line: Oh, right. Er, thanks.
- direction: The Doctor and Jo leave. Tyler takes the x-ray plate from the box and
    starts using lab equipment.
- character: TYLER
  line: Oh, I can manage now, thank you.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: I'm delighted to hear it. Make yourself at home. We're only supposed to be
    a top secret security establishment. Liberty Hall, Doctor Tyler. Liberty Hall.
- direction: The Brigadier leaves. Tyler checks his watch then gets the developed
    image from the machine.
- character: TYLER
  line: That shouldn't happen.
- direction: He puts the image on a light box. It looks like a face contorted in fear.
- character: TYLER
  line: That definitely shouldn't happen.
- direction: Tyler starts dismantling the box, and it begins crackling. There is a
    flash, and Tyler has vanished. Then some red and blue energy creeps out of the
    box onto the bench.
- location: Lake side
- direction: The Doctor's Geiger counter is rattling away.
- character: MRS OLLIS
  line: This here's the place all right.
- character: JO
  line: Are you sure, Mrs Ollis?
- character: MRS OLLIS
  line: Well, the Land Rover tracks stop here, don't they? I told you, you're too
    late. The other gentleman's been and gone.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: You haven't seen your husband since this morning?
- character: MRS OLLIS
  line: No. Nothing unusual in that. Oh, he'll be off somewhere. We shan't see him
    now until dark. I'll look for him if you like.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: No. No, it's not important.
- character: MRS OLLIS
  line: Please yourself. I'll be getting on then.
- direction: Mrs Ollis walks off.
- character: JO
  line: It is important, isn't it, Doctor?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, Jo. Yes, it's much more important than I thought.
- location: UNIT Laboratory
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Doctor Tyler, these reports might interest
- direction: The Brigadier realises the room is empty.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Tyler? Doctor Tyler? Sergeant Benton!
- direction: Benton enters.
- character: BENTON
  line: Sir?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Doctor Tyler appears to be wandering around UNIT Head Quarters. Go and find
    him and bring him here at once.
- character: BENTON
  line: Yes, sir.
- location: Behind UNIT HQ
- direction: The top secret HQ is actually well advertised. The notice in front of
    the Denham Manor clearly states Ministry of Defence U.N.I.T. Headquarters Brigadier
    Lethbridge Stewart No Unauthorised Entry - without a guard to be seen. The Doctor
    and Jo drive round the back to the garage area and park up.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Right, let's see what Doctor Tyler's found out about that plate.
- character: JO
  line: What's that?
- direction: A bright red and blue something is coming out of the drain in the middle
    of the area.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Jo! Back slowly away behind the car. Do as I say!
- direction: The thing is growing.
- character: JO
  line: What is it?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: When I tell you to run, you run. Right, run!
- direction: They run for the shrubbery as there is a flash and Bessie vanishes. The
    Doctor and Jo peer out from behind a tree.
- character: JO
  line: What happened? What is that?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: I don't know.
- direction: The Thing goes back down the drain.
- character: JO
  line: Poor old Bessie.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Right, Come on.
- location: UNIT Laboratory
- direction: Benton enters.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Well, where is he?
- character: BENTON
  line: Sorry sir, we just couldn't find him. Doctor Tyler has just disappeared. We've
    searched the grounds and the buildings, sir, and there's no sign of him. Oh, and
    there was an explosion in the garage, sir.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Explosion? What explosion? I heard nothing.
- direction: The Doctor and Jo enter.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: No, you wouldn't, Brigadier.
- character: BENTON
  line: But there was a flash, Doctor.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: A flash, yes, not an explosion. It was a release of kinetic energy.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: One of Bessie's gadgets misfire?
- character: JO
  line: It's far more serious than that, Brigadier.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: You'd better check, Benton.
- character: BENTON
  line: Right, sir.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: No. I shouldn't go anywhere near it. Not just at the moment.
- character: BENTON
  line: What shall I do, sir?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: I suggest that you put a guard on the drains, Benton.
- character: BENTON
  line: The drains?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, the drains!
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Put the men on stand by, Benton.
- character: BENTON
  line: Right away, sir.
- direction: Benton leaves.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: All right, Brigadier. Now then, what's the situation as you see it?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Well, I've just had a call from Mrs Ollis. Her husband hasn't returned.
- character: JO
  line: Oh, no.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, I was rather afraid that might happen.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: We're cooperating with the local Police, but we have got fifteen hundred acres
    to cover.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Well, I shouldn't bother going on looking for him, Brigadier. I think you'll
    find that that's Mister Ollis.
- direction: The Doctor shows the Brigadier the new image.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Is this the plate that Tyler was developing when we left?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, that's right.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: When I came back with these satellite reports, Tyler had disappeared and this
    box was open as it is now.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Nothing's been moved?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Nothing.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Excuse me a minute, will you?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Hmm.
- direction: The Brigadier and Jo stand back as the Doctor waves his Geiger counter
    over the box. Background only until he gets to the sink and plug hole.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: All right, Brigadier, go on.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: These are tracking reports and assessments from just about every country in
    the world.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Thank you. It looks as if Tyler was right. That light beam or whatever it
    is, seems to have scanned the Earth like a searchlight and picked on us.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Since UNIT is now in charge of this investigation, Doctor, it would help if
    you were a little more forthcoming.
- character: JO
  line: Tell him about Bessie, Doctor.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Huh? Oh, yes. Well, Brigadier, now Bessie has disappeared.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: What?
- character: JO
  line: But it was after us.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Yes, but what was after you?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Well, some kind of powerful organism thing with a very strong hunting instinct.
- character: JO
  line: It was hunting you, wasn't it, Doctor?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes. Yes, I'm afraid so.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Are you trying to tell me that this whole thing has been arranged just for
    your benefit?
- character: JO
  line: Oh yes, that's right. You see that stuff simply ignored me as soon as it saw
    the Doctor.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: What about this chap Ollis?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Oh, I don't know. Well, perhaps this thing was confused, or its instructions
    weren't getting through.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: And Tyler?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Tyler? Yeah. Yes, that was its second mistake, here in this laboratory where
    I usually work. And its third mistake was Bessie.
- character: JO
  line: And you were in Bessie.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: And you think there's a link between the beam and this, this organism thing.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, I do. I think that that beam was the method it used to get here.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Well, now it's arrived, and it's hostile, and it's still here, so what do
    we do and how do we find it?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: We don't find it, Brigadier. If we wait around here long enough, it'll find
    us.
- location: Outside UNIT HQ
- direction: Three strange objects appear out of nowhere, looking like snowmen made
    of red balls. Apparently these are called Gel guards.
- character: GUARD
  line: Holy Moses! What's that?
- direction: The objects advance, growling.
- character: GUARD
  line: Get Sergeant Benton, quick!
- direction: The second soldier runs inside. Meanwhile, more of the objects appear
    in the woodland around the buildings.
- character: BENTON
  line: How many of them?
- character: GUARD
  line: I'm not sure, Sarge. They seem to be springing out all over the place.
- character: BENTON
  line: Right. You hold them off here, and I'll cover the back. Right, you men come
    with me. Hurry.
- direction: Two soldiers stay with the guard.
- character: GUARD
  line: Fire at will!
- direction: Bullets have no effect. One object raises a claw-like hand and fires.
    There's a big bang and just two soldiers retreat.
- location: UNIT Laboratory
- direction: Watching from the window.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: What are those creatures? Where are they coming from?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Obviously from the same source as that organism thing. First the scout, then
    the reinforcements.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Their grasp of military tactics is very good.
- character: JO
  line: Well, let's hope Sergeant Benton's are even better.
- location: Outside UNIT HQ
- direction: More Gels are popping into existence on the lawns. A machine gun is brought
    out and set up.
- character: BENTON
  line: Hurry, men, and keep your heads down.
- direction: The machine guns is soon destroyed. By a handy signpost to the Laboratory
    and Stores, one of Benton's men fires a bazooka which seems to stop one.
- character: BENTON
  line: Great shot, Johnson.
- direction: But it keeps coming. Benson reports in.
- character: BENTON
  line: Brigadier, do you read me? Over.
- character: BRIGADIER
  direction: OC
  line: What's the situation, Benton? Over.
- character: BENTON
  line: We're under attack from all sides. Weapons are useless. Nothing seems to touch
    them. Nothing. Over.
- location: UNIT Laboratory
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Get the men out, Benton. Complete evacuation, then report to me in the laboratory.
    Is that clear? Over.
- character: BENTON
  direction: OC
  line: Okay, lads, fall back! Complete evacuation. I want everyone out of the building.
    Everybody. Now, move.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: I'd better see what's happening. You stay here, Doctor.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Not much point in my going anywhere else is there?
- direction: The Brigadier leaves, and the Thing comes out of a vent in the corridor.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: I think you ought to get out of here too, Jo.
- character: JO
  line: Not a chance. I'm staying right here with you.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Now please, Jo, do as I ask. They won't harm you. You ignore them, they'll
    ignore you. I'm the one they're after.
- character: JO
  line: Well, I'll just have to risk it, won't I?
- direction: Benton climbs in through the window.
- character: BENTON
  line: Right, Jo, Doctor, have you seen the Brigadier?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Sergeant Benton. Just the man I wanted to see. Will you please take Miss Grant
    with you? Even if you have to carry her.
- character: BENTON
  line: I'm sorry, Doc, my orders were to report to the Brigadier.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Your orders, Sergeant
- direction: There is a flash, and the doors and part of the wall vanish.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Into the Tardis, quickly!
- location: Tardis
- direction: This is Benton's first time, so he looks around as the doors close.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Right, force field on.
- direction: The Thing zaps the laboratory bench.
- character: JO
  line: You were going off without me, weren't you?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Well, Sergeant, aren't you going to say it that it's bigger on the inside
    than it is on the outside. Everybody else does.
- character: BENTON
  line: It's pretty obvious, isn't it? Anyway, nothing to do with you surprises me
    anymore, Doctor.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Oh, thank you for the complement.
- direction: The Doctor pulls a lever but there is only a thudddd sound. He tries
    again.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: It's not reacting. There's only one thing for it. I'll have to send an SOS.
    I hate having to call them, but, there we are.
- character: JO
  line: What were you planning to do, anyhow?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: I was planning to lure that stuff away from Earth, Jo, but now as it seems
    to have immobilised the Tardis, I'm not going anywhere. We're trapped.
- character: JO
  line: So what are we going to do?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: At least we can watch that thing in comfort, and then we can send in a report
    and see what they have to say about it.
- character: BENTON
  line: Who are they?
- character: JO
  line: The Time Lords. Oh, things are pretty serious.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, they are.
- direction: The scanner flickers into life. and the Extreme Emergency red light flashes.
- location: Time control
- direction: On a planet far away in time and space.
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: Is the Doctor holding out?
- character: TIME LORD
  line: We are giving his Tardis all the energy we can spare.
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: And the hostile?
- character: TIME LORD
  line: Unidentified so far, my lord.
- character: CHANCELLOR
  line: And the source of this beam?
- direction: The Time Lord brings it up on his wall screen.
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: You see, Chancellor? The black hole.
- character: CHANCELLOR
  line: That's a nowhere, no place, a void. According to all known laws, nothing can
    exist there.
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: Yet somehow, through this black hole, vital cosmic energy is draining away
    in spite of all we can do to check it.
- character: CHANCELLOR
  line: Already the time travel facility is in danger, my lord.
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: Without it, we shall be helpless. Unless the energy loss is stopped the whole
    fabric of space time will be destroyed. We are being consumed and we can find
    no way to fight back.
- character: CHANCELLOR
  line: Are you telling me we are up against an adversary, a force, equal to our own?
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: Equal and opposite to our own.
- character: CHANCELLOR
  line: A force which inhabits a universe where by definition even we cannot exist?
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: Yes. A force in the universe of antimatter.
- character: CHANCELLOR
  line: But that's too terrible to contemplate. Someone must go and help the Doctor.
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: I agree, but no one can be spared, your Excellency. Everyone is needed to
    combat the energy drain.
- character: CHANCELLOR
  line: Are you saying we can't help him?
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: Yes, I am, but perhaps he can help himself. Show me the Doctor's time stream,
    the section for his earlier self before he changed his form.
- character: CHANCELLOR
  line: You can't allow him to cross his own time stream. Apart from the enormous
    energy it would need, the First Law of Time expressly forbids him to meet his
    other selves.
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: I am aware of that, your Excellency, but this is an emergency.
- character: CHANCELLOR
  line: But you can't!
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: Your Excellency, I have to.
- character: CHANCELLOR
  line: Be it on your own head.
- direction: The Chancellor leaves.
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: Now, show me.
- direction: The image on the screen changes to Patrick Troughton running from something,
    as usual.
- location: Tardis
- direction: There is a materialisation sound, but the time rotor is still.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: That's odd. Nobody touched anything did they?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: But you heard it though, didn't you?
- character: JO
  line: Yes, and felt it too. Could it be that stuff outside?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: No, I don't think so. Hello, what's this?
- direction: There is a descant recorder on the console. He picks it up.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: It seems strangely familiar. Is it yours, Jo?
- character: JO
  line: A flute? No.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Well, properly speaking it's a recorder.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Thank you.
- direction: First of all Patrick's hand takes the recorder then the rest of him appears.
    Jo gasps.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: I was wondering where that had got too.
- direction: He blows a few notes.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: You haven't been trying to play this have you? Oh. I can see you've been doing
    the Tardis up a bit. Hmm. I don't like it.
- direction: He looks at the scanner.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Oh my word.
- direction: The Thing is wrecking the laboratory.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Oh dear, we are in trouble, aren't we. Just as well I turned up.
- character: JO
  line: Doctor, who on earth
- character: BENTON
  line: Doctor! Where did you spring from?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Now don't tell me. Corporal Benton, isn't it?
- character: BENTON
  line: Sergeant Benton now.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: How do you do, my dear fellow.
- character: BENTON
  line: Nice to see you.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: I haven't seen you since that nasty business with the Cybermen.
- character: BENTON
  line: It happened all those years ago.
- character: JO
  line: Who is he and how did he get in here.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Well it's a bit difficult to explain, Jo.
- character: JO
  line: He's not one of them, is he?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Well, not so much one of them as one of us. One of me to be precise.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Oh no, no, no, no. I'm sorry, my dear, I hate to be contrary but I can see
    he's a little bit confused, poor old chap, and I do feel you should have the correct
    explanation. You don't mind, do you.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: I didn't think you would. You see, Jo. I may call you Jo, mayn't I? You see,
    he is one of me.
- character: JO
  line: Oh, I see. You're both Time Lords.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Well quite. Well, not quite.
- character: JO
  line: Oh.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Not, not just Time Lords. We're the same Time Lord.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Now please, you're only confusing my assistant. Jo, it's all quite simple.
    I am he and he is me.
- character: JO
  line: '"And we are all together, goo goo ga joob?"'
- character: DOCTORS
  line: What?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Oh, how does it go?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Oh, please be quiet.
- character: JO
  line: Look, is he really you?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, yes, I'm afraid so.
- character: BENTON
  line: I think he is Miss Grant. You see, when the Brig and I first met the Doctor,
    he looked like him.
- character: JO
  line: How?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, that's what I'd like to know. You've got no right to be here.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Perhaps
- character: DOCTOR
  line: What about the First Law of Time?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Perhaps I could explain?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Perhaps you could.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Well, our fellow Time Lords out there are just as much under siege as we are.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: What?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: And they couldn't send anyone to help you. But they did summon up enough temporal
    energy to lift me out of my bit of our time stream and pop me down here, into
    my own future, so to speak.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Why?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: My dear fellow, you are being a bit dim, aren't you? Your effectiveness is
    now doubled!
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Halved, more like.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Now, now. There's no need to be ungracious. Suppose we have a look at our
    problem, shall we? Er, you don't mind, do you?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Oh, be my guest.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Oh, thank you.
- location: Outside the Laboratory
- character: SOLDIER
  line: Good grief, sir. What's that?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Don't just stand there, man. Open fire!
- direction: He does. There is a flash and the water dispenser in the corridor next
    to them vanishes.
- character: SOLDIER
  line: Sir!
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Fall back!
- location: Tardis
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Dear old Lethbridge Stewart. Still blazing away as usual.
- character: BENTON
  line: Can't we do something to help them, Doctor?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: They'll be all right as long as they keep out of its way. Right, now you can
    see our problem, can't you.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Yes. Most unpleasant. They are very worried, you know.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, and so am I. I think perhaps I ought to put you in the picture.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Right.
- direction: The two Doctors stand side by side and close their eyes.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Contact.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Contact.
- direction: After a few moments they open their eyes again.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: I see. So it's after you, or should I say us?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: That's right. And as they can't help us, we'll just have to help ourselves.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Twinkle, twinkle little star.
- direction: And starts to play it on the recorder.
- character: BENTON
  line: Now what was all that about?
- character: JO
  line: A sort of telepathic conference, I think.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Must you?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Are we going to take this attitude to my music all the time?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, I'm rather afraid we are.
- character: JO
  line: Oh dear.
- location: Time Control
- direction: The Time Lords are watching the scene in the Tardis.
- character: TIME LORD
  line: We've achieved a transference, sir.
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: Splendid.
- character: TIME LORD
  line: But I don't think it's going to work.
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: Why, what's wrong?
- character: TIME LORD
  line: They refuse to co-operate.
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: I see. Well, we'll soon settle that. Show me the earliest Doctor.
- character: TIME LORD
  line: Him too, sir? But surely
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: Show me.
- direction: William Hartnell is in a garden.
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: He'll keep them in order.
- location: Tardis
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Well, you've been fiddling with it, haven't you?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: It was perfectly all right until you touched it. Now if only you'd leave things
    to me.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: If we were to leave things with you, my dear fellow, we'd be in a fine pickle,
    wouldn't we.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Look, you lost the image, not me.
- character: BENTON
  line: There they go again.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: I did not loose the image!
- character: DOCTOR
  line: I set this thing up
- character: JO
  line: Doctor, look. Both of you!
- character: DOCTOR
  line: What?
- character: JO
  line: Look.
- direction: The scanner shows William inside a pyramid shape. He was too ill to act,
    bless him.
- character: DOCTOR 1
  line: '[on scanner] Ah, there you are. I seem to be stuck up here. Hmm? Hmm? Oh,
    so you''re my replacements. Huh. A dandy and a clown. Have you done anything?'
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Well, we've, er, assessed the situation.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Well it's not easy, you know.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: It's not as if we know what that stuff is.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: No.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: It's a what?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: I see.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Well, er
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Crossing?
- direction: The image fades.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: No! No wait!
- character: DOCTOR
  line: You faded him again.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: I did not fade him. You saw
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, you certainly did.
- character: JO
  line: I hate to ask, but who was that?&nbsp;
- character: DOCTORS
  line: Me. Me!
- direction: Patrick takes a coin from his pocket.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Call, will you?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Heads.
- direction: Patrick tosses the coin, catches it and looks at it then puts it back
    in his pocket without letting Jon see it.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Hard luck.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: All right. Stand by to disconnect the force field.
- character: BENTON
  line: What are you going to do?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Now!
- character: JO
  line: Doctor, no!
- location: UNIT Laboratory
- direction: The Doctor runs out of the Tardis into the lab, followed by Jo.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Jo, get back!
- direction: There is a flash of light and they both vanish.
- location: Tardis
- direction: Benton runs to the door.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Steady now, Sergeant. He knows what he's doing. At least I hope he does.
- character: BENTON
  line: Yes, but what about Jo?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Yes, it's a pity she ran after him like that. Let's have a look, shall we?
- character: BENTON
  line: Will they be all right?
- direction: The scanner image shows the Tardis in the corner of the lab, and the
    massive red and blue Thing pulsing nearby.
- character: BENTON
  line: Well, where are they? Doctor!
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: As far as I can see, that stuff's gone to a great deal of trouble to find
    me, er, him, so whoever or whatever it was that sent it can't merely want to kill
    him. No, no, they've been transported somewhere.
- character: BENTON
  line: Transported? What do you mean, transported? Transported to where?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: No, wait a minute. Do you know, Sergeant, I think our friend has gone off
    the boil, so to speak.
- character: BENTON
  line: Right then. Now I'm going to take this chance to blow it to bits. I'll get
    a grenade. We'll soon see
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: No, I think we could try a more subtle approach. Let's turn off the force
    field and open the doors first, shall we?
- character: BENTON
  line: Right.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Wait a minute. Let me go first.
- location: UNIT Laboratory
- direction: They step out carefully, Benton with his sub-machine gun at the ready.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Hmm. Awaiting further instructions, I would think.
- direction: The Thing suddenly crackles and they dash back into the Tardis. It settles
    down again and they come out again.
- character: BENTON
  line: You're not going near that thing, Doctor, are you?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: It's all right. I think it was just hiccups. Fascinating.
- direction: The Thing crackles again.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: For heaven's sake be careful, Doctor!
- location: Outside the UNIT Laboratory
- direction: Patrick and Benton go into the corridor through the remains of the wall.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: No, no, Brigadier. Leave it alone. It's not dangerous for the moment. It seems
    to think it's achieved its mission.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Oh, no.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Oh, yes.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Yes, but you're not the
- character: BENTON
  line: Yes, it is, sir. It's the first one.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: How are you, Brigadier?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Pretty well, thanks. Doctor, what the blazes are you doing? Why have you changed
    your appearance? And what's happened to Miss Grant?
- direction: The Doctor and Jo have just appeared, lying on their sides, on some dirty
    rocky ground somewhere.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: There you are. It's all quite simple really.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Yes, well, I'm sorry. Well, I don't believe a word of it. Look, just tell
    me this. Are you or are you not the Doctor that I met during the Yeti business,
    and then later when the Cybermen invaded?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Of course I am. You can see that.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Right. But then you subsequently appeared on Earth during that trouble with
    the Autons, only then you'd changed into a tall, thin fellow.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Had I really? How fascinating.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Doctor, I warn you.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: It's no use your asking me about all this, Brigadier. As far as I'm concerned,
    it hasn't happened yet. Don't you see? I'm just a temporal anomaly.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: It's quite obvious to me what's happened. You've been mucking around with
    that infernal machine of yours.
- character: BENTON
  line: Be careful, sir.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: You've been mucking around with that infernal machine of yours, and somehow
    or other you've changed back your appearance and shot poor Miss Grant off to heaven
    knows where.
- character: BENTON
  line: It's not quite as simple as that, sir, honestly.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Now that'll do, Benton. Just two things I want from you, Doctor. An effective
    way of controlling that stuff and the safe return of Miss Grant.
- character: BENTON
  line: What about our Doctor, sir? Don't you want him back?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Enough of that nonsense, Benton. I've got him back. As long as he does the
    job, he can wear what face he likes.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Well, I'll do my best, but I can't make any promises.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: In that case, you'd better consult those all-powerful superiors of yours for
    their advice.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Oh, I don't think that'd do any good. At the moment they're far from being
    all-powerful. That's why it's been left up to me and me and me.
- location: Time Control
- character: CHANCELLOR
  line: What's happening?
- character: TIME LORD
  line: It's draining our power as fast as we pump it in, sir.
- character: CHANCELLOR
  line: Yet you continue to waste the power we so urgently need. What is more, by
    permitting the Doctor to meet his other selves, you have transgressed the first
    and most important law of time.
- character: TIME LORD
  line: I know that, your Excellency, but this is an emergency.
- character: CHANCELLOR
  line: No emergency can justify this transgression. This operation must stop immediately.
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: On the contrary, it must continue. The Doctor is our only hope. There is no
    one else.
- character: CHANCELLOR
  line: I could wish for more hope than that.
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: Your Excellency, you have said yourself we are dealing with a threat from
    an area over which even we have no control. A black hole in space. The universe
    of antimatter. Unknown forces at least equal and opposite to our own.
- character: CHANCELLOR
  line: But the first law of time must be obeyed!
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: It will be obeyed, later. For the moment the Doctor needs all the help he
    can get. We can't stop now. Transporting his other selves across the time stream
    has already utilised more energy than we can afford.
- character: CHANCELLOR
  line: Criminal irresponsibility.
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: They have only a limited time together, and if they do not succeed we shall
    lose our time travel facility and become as vulnerable as those we are pledged
    to protect.
- character: CHANCELLOR
  line: You would do better to husband your resources, not throw them away on what
    is no more than a dangerous gamble.
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: I am prepared to take that risk.
- character: CHANCELLOR
  line: I understand your attempt to transport yet one more Doctor has met with only
    limited success.
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: His transportation unit became trapped in a time eddy. At the moment he can
    do no more than advise, but the second Doctor is assisting UNIT to help with matters
    on Earth.
- character: CHANCELLOR
  line: I see. And the other?
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: He, together with his companion, has passed into the black hole. They are
    over the absolute event horizon.
- character: CHANCELLOR
  line: Theoretically, they're dead.
- location: Planet surface
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Jo? Jo? Can you hear me? Jo, wake up.
- character: JO
  line: Where are we? Everything seems so strange.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Are you all right?
- character: JO
  line: We're not?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Jo.
- character: JO
  line: We are, aren't we. We're dead.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: This is a place. It's just like any other place. Well, almost. We've been
    brought here. Anyway, it's not much like heaven, is it. Come on, let's go and
    take a look around.
- direction: They start walking through the quarry, watched by one of the Gels.
- location: Outside the Laboratory
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: So wherever they are, Miss Grant and my other self, we can't contact them.
    That's the problem with antimatter. You can see the effect but never the cause.
    It's like being punched on the nose by the invisible man.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Then what's this stuff?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: The invisible man. Antimatter.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: But I thought you said that matter and antimatter couldn't meet without an
    explosion.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Yes, that's right.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: So, it shouldn't exist here, but it does.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Yes. Awkward, isn't it? As far as I can see, there's only one explanation.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Yes?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Well, this stuff, or whoever sent it, is cleverer than we are. Unfortunate,
    isn't it.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: And there's nothing that even you can do?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Oh, I wouldn't say that. We can make sure it stays harmless for a start.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Oh, that's a relief. Look, can I leave you to get on with that? Those other
    things are still outside there. I must contact Geneva.
- direction: The Brigadier leaves. Patrick searches through all his pockets.
- character: BENTON
  line: Doc, I think the strain's been a bit too much for him. What are we going to
    do now?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Keep it confused. Feed it with useless information. I wonder if I have a television
    set handy.
- location: Planet surface
- direction: The Doctor and Jo come across the water dispenser and a computer unit.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: That's odd.
- character: JO
  line: Hey, surely that's the water cooler from outside the lab.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes.
- character: JO
  line: And what's this?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Well, that's the Brigadier's computer.
- character: JO
  line: Oh.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Look, this is the lab door.
- character: JO
  line: It's locked.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Well, it says No Admittance.
- direction: They walk past the coat hanger to the workbench with the weather balloon
    box on it.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes. Well, we both know what that is, don't we?
- character: JO
  line: Sure do.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Er, Jo, do you see what I see?
- character: JO
  line: Oh, yes!
- character: DOCTOR
  line: That clinches it. We have been transported, and so has all this stuff. Come
    on.
- direction: They walk down a slope and get into Bessie.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Right. All we've got to do is find out where we are and who brought us here.
- character: JO
  line: Right, come on then.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Where to?
- character: JO
  line: Twice round the park?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Right.
- character: JO
  line: Right.
- direction: And off they drive, watched of course. Bessie stops further on and they
    get out to look at a set of boot prints in the chalk.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Man Friday, would you believe?
- character: JO
  line: At the moment, I'd believe anything.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Come on.
- direction: They set off to follow the prints, and Arthur Ollis peers over a ridge.
- location: UNIT Laboratory
- direction: Patrick has set up a large dish on a stand attached to a transformer
    while the Thing crackles gently in the corner.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: It's quite like old time, eh, Sergeant?
- character: BENTON
  line: Yes, it is, isn't it. Is it ready yet?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Hmm? Oh, nearly ready for testing.
- character: BENTON
  line: Look, Doc, why don't we give this great big blancmange the full treatment
    now?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Now steady on, Sergeant.
- direction: The Brigadier enters.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Right, come on, Doctor. Security Council want an explanation and I'm leaving
    it all up to you.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Oh, no.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: They're on video in my office.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: But won't they think it strange? I mean, me?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: I've explained all that. You're his assistant.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: His what!
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: I decided the truth was too much for them. Assistant it will have to be. Well?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Well, I've just set this thing up! Now I won't be able to confuse it!
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: No doubt. It seems to be your forte, Doctor, confusing people. You're sure
    that thing's all right?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Yes, as quiet as a lamb. We've got it thoroughly subdued, haven't we, Sergeant.
- character: BENTON
  line: We haven't tested it.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: All right then, Benton, you'd better keep an eye on it.
- character: BENTON
  line: Me, sir?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Yes, you.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Oh, very well. Here you are, Sergeant, you'll need this. Now if it gives the
    slightest trouble, a little dose of that will settle it.
- direction: Patrick hands over a control pad with a red button.
- character: BENTON
  line: Yes, but say that doesn't work, Doctor?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Then give it the lot! Come on, Brigadier.
- direction: Patrick and the Brigadier leave. Benton hangs the control on the dish
    and unwraps some chewing gum.
- character: BENTON
  line: Now you're not going to give me any trouble, are you, okay?
- direction: The Thing starts crackling and Benton picks up the control. He gives
    it a short burst of a crackle from the dish, then a second. It has no effect.
- character: BENTON
  line: Doctor? Doctor, are you there?
- direction: Benton turns the machine on full.
- character: BENTON
  line: Doctor! Doctor! Doctor!
- direction: Patrick runs round the corner followed by the Brigadier.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: What is it? Oh!
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Benton, what have you done?
- character: BENTON
  line: I did what the Doctor told me, sir, but it wouldn't work. It's gone mad.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Into the Tardis, quickly! Come on, Brigadier!
- direction: The doors close just before the big flash.
- location: Tardis
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Yes, it's quite cozy, isn't it? Oh, you'll soon get used to it, old chap.
    Relative dimensions and all that.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: So this is what you've been doing with UNIT funds and equipment all this time.
    How's it done? Some sort of optical illusion?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Oh, no, no, no. They come like this. Really.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Yeah.
- character: BENTON
  line: Hey, Doc, it's going berserk out there.
- direction: Lots of flashes on the scanner.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Yes, it is, isn't it.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: All right, now we're in here, what do we do?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Oh, we have a think. Care for a jelly baby?
- location: Planet surface
- direction: Someone is been writing equations in the chalk.
- character: TYLER
  line: E equals MC squared. There's no doubt about that. But if you equate gravitation
    with acceleration, I must have travelled faster than the speed of light. That's
    impossible. By definition, the light here must be travelling backwards, but I
    can still see.
- character: JO
  line: Who's that?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: It's Doctor Tyler. Doctor Tyler!
- character: TYLER
  line: Huh? Why, it's the Doctor, isn't it? And Miss Grant.
- character: JO
  line: How did you get here?
- character: TYLER
  line: Well, I was in your lab, developing that plate, and there was some kind of
    an explosion and here I am. Oh, it's fascinating.
- character: JO
  line: Do you know where we are, Doctor Tyler?
- character: TYLER
  line: No, I don't. Do you, Doctor?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes. We're at the other end of that light streak of yours.
- character: TYLER
  line: What?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: We've been transported along it.
- character: TYLER
  line: That's in the black hole.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, exactly. That's where we are. On a stable world in a universe of antimatter.
    An anomaly within an impossibility.
- character: JO
  line: Huh?
- character: TYLER
  line: What he means is that a place like this shouldn't exist in a cosmos like this,
    and even if it does, we shouldn't be here anyway. I think.
- character: JO
  line: Oh.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Well, here we are. Kidnapped and marooned. But by whom?
- location: Throne room
- direction: Someone is watching them on a screen set into the rock wall.
- character: OMEGA
  line: At last, a Time Lord within my power. Let my guests be brought into my presence.
- direction: The masked figure wearing a cloak like the Time Lords do, sends one of
    the Gels off to do his bidding.
- location: Planet surface
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Well, these things sound very much like the creatures that attacked us at
    UNIT HQ.
- character: JO
  line: Yeah.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: What exactly did they look like?
- character: TYLER
  line: Like that.
- direction: There are a pair of them on the cliff above them. Jo screams.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Run!
- direction: But a set of explosions go off all around them, so they surrender instead.
    Ollis is watching from a safe vantage point.
- location: Tardis
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Doctor, will you open this door?
- character: BENTON
  line: It's still thrashing about out there, sir.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Yes, it is, isn't it. My little plan seems to have misfired. I seem to have
    accentuated its metabolic rate
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Doctor!
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Most unfortunate. It shouldn't have happened. Now, what went wrong?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Will you let me out of this contraption!
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: The beam should have desensitised. Of course, you fool. It's antimatter! The
    opposite effect! Instead of quietening down, I've stimulated it.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Will you stop nattering?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: You haven't seen my recorder anywhere, have you? It's a little thing about
    this long with holes in. I had it when I came in and I put it down somewhere and
    I can't find it.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: For the last time, will you let me out of this madhouse!
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: There's no point.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: I'm sorry, Doctor, but I'm afraid I must insist. My place is with the men
    out there, trying to do something about this, well, whatever it is out there,
    not standing around here messing about looking for some damn fool flute!
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Brigadier, I cannot open that door without first turning off the force field,
    and even if I did, you'd never make it across the floor. That thing out there
    has become a killer. It's my fault and I'm sorry.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Sorry?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: All we can do now is think, and I think best to music. Now, where is my recorder?
- location: Omega's palace
- direction: Jon, Jo and Tyler are escorted into a corridor built like the Gels, of
    bright balls.
- character: JO
  line: It looks like Aladdin's cave.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: It's the entrance to some sort of palace, I should imagine.
- character: TYLER
  line: I wonder who it belongs to?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: I've no idea, but I expect we'll soon find out.
- character: JO
  line: I'm not sure that I really want to.
- character: TYLER
  line: Whoever had us brought here doesn't mean us much good.
- character: JO
  line: I have a feeling you might be right.
- character: TYLER
  line: And I don't fancy hanging around to meet him. I'm going to try and make a
    break for it.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: What?
- location: Tardis
- direction: The Brigadier gets a radio handset out of his pocket.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Corporal Palmer, this is the Brigadier. Do you read me? Over.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: You're wasting your time. You'll never get through with the force field on.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: I've got to find out what's going on out there.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Let's have a look at this thing.
- direction: Patrick starts to take the handset apart.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: I'll try to set you up a communications unit.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Be careful.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: It's all right. Don't worry. I can boost this through the Tardis's communication
    circuit. I think.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Oh, I give up.
- character: BENTON
  line: With respect, sir, aren't we wasting time?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Yes, we are.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Are you still worried about your other Doctor, Sergeant?
- character: BENTON
  line: Well, yes, I am, and Miss Grant.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Well, I shouldn't worry too much if I were you. In fact, I rather envy them.
- character: BENTON
  line: You what?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Yes, I think they're having a very interesting time.
- location: Omega's palace
- character: TYLER
  line: The time to make a getaway is now, while we're still near the entrance. Once
    they get us down that maze of passageways we shall never get out.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: My dear Doctor Tyler, I don't want to get out. I want to meet our host. I
    allowed myself to be brought here for that very purpose.
- character: TYLER
  line: Perhaps you did, Doctor, but we didn't want to come here and we don't want
    to stay.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Don't you understand? You were both brought here by accident. Your only chance
    of getting back lies in my persuading whoever brought you here to send you home.
- character: TYLER
  line: I prefer to take a chance on my own. How about you, Miss Grant? Are you coming
    with me?
- character: JO
  line: No. No, I'll stick with the Doctor, thank you.
- character: TYLER
  line: Looks like I'll have to go on my own then.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Doctor Tyler, you're not going anywhere.
- character: TYLER
  line: What?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: I refuse to allow you to endanger all our lives.
- character: TYLER
  line: No. No, I suppose you're right.
- direction: Tyler makes a dash for it.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Tyler! Tyler, come back! Tyler!
- direction: Gels stop the Doctor from following.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Idiot. He'll jeopardise the entire operation.
- character: JO
  line: With his life, probably.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes.
- direction: A Gel follows Tyler through the passages.
- character: JO
  line: They might not harm him. You said we were only here by mistake.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, that's right, Jo. I'm the one they're after. I'm sure I can persuade
    our host to send you back.
- character: JO
  line: But supposing you can't? Well, they might just get rid of us.
- direction: Tyler's way is blocked by a Gel. He retreats.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Jo, we're dealing here with a creature of great intelligence, and superior
    intelligence and senseless cruelty just do not go together.
- character: JO
  line: Oh, I hope you're right.
- direction: Tyler runs back to them and falls.
- character: JO
  line: Tyler!
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Tyler! Come on, get up. Up, up. Are you all right?
- character: TYLER
  line: Yes, I think so. Thanks. That was a bit of a waste of time, wasn't it.
- location: Tardis
- direction: The Brigadier paces while Patrick works on his handset.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Here we are, Brigadier. Have a try with that. It's all right, it won't bite
    you.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Corporal Palmer? Come in, Palmer.
- direction: All he gets is crackling, so the Pat bashes it against the Tardis console
    a couple of times.
- character: PALMER
  direction: OC
  line: Corporal Palmer here. Over.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Corporal Palmer, this is the Brigadier. Now listen. We're pinned down in the
    laboratory. What's the situation there? Over.
- character: PALMER
  direction: OC
  line: Ah, sir, we've been trying to reach you. The building is still surrounded
    but we're just standing by for further orders. Over.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Now listen, Palmer. I want every man to maintain vigilance, but no further
    offensive action, is that clear? Over.
- character: PALMER
  direction: OC
  line: But sir, I thought
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: That's an order, Palmer!
- character: PALMER
  direction: OC
  line: Roger, sir. Wilco.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Keep in contact. Out.
- character: BENTON
  line: Doc.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Hmm?
- character: BENTON
  line: Hey, Doctor, it's the old boy.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Oh, excuse me.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: No, none at all. And you?
- character: DOCTOR 1
  line: Hardly. I'm trapped in this infernal time eddy.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: What about our fellow Time Lords?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: We can't help you, I'm afraid.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Oh? How?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: What? But I don't
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: But I still don't see
- direction: The image fades.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Who in the name of heaven was that?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: I'm afraid you'd never believe me.
- location: Palace
- direction: Jon, Tyler and Jo are being escorted through the passageways.
- character: TYLER
  line: It still doesn't make sense, Doctor. We are matter, and you say this place
    is antimatter.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: That's right.
- character: TYLER
  line: So, the mere fact of our being here should cause a colossal explosion.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, well, our bodies have been converted, processed in some ways, so that
    we can exist here.
- character: JO
  line: Just as that organism thing could exist in our world?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, exactly.
- character: TYLER
  line: I just don't believe it. This is matter. I can see it. Why, I can feel it.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: But things aren't always as they seem, you know, Doctor Tyler. Now, you take
    this pencil, for example.
- character: TYLER
  line: It's just a pencil, isn't it?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Ah, but is it? Watch very, very closely.
- direction: 'The Doctor holds the pencil out vertically, at arms length, then lets
    go with a flourish. It vanishes. Another flourish and '
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Or is it a bunch of flowers?
- character: TYLER
  line: Ah ha, that's all very well, but that's just a conjuring trick.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, that's exactly what this place is, a scientific conjuring trick of a
    very high order. I think the waiting is over.
- direction: There is a strange growling yet burbling noise, and the Gels usher them
    along again. Jo leaves behind the fake flowers on the floor.
- location: Tardis
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: But you're not going to turn off the force field?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Yes, I think so.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: But why?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Because he told me to, and I've always had a great respect for his advice.
- character: BENTON
  line: Doctor, if you switch the force field off, that thing out there can get at
    the Tardis.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Precisely! Hold tight, everyone.
- direction: Outside UNIT HQ, the Gels suddenly vanish. Then the building itself vanishes
    and falls into the black hole, leaving Corporal Palmer and his men in the gardens,
    staring at the empty space.
- location: Throne room
- direction: The Gels escort Tyler, Jo and Jon into the main room.
- character: JO
  line: It's fabulous!
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, most impressive, I must admit that.
- character: TYLER
  line: Almost worth the trip just to see this place.
- character: JO
  line: Yes, but who brought us here, and why?
- direction: A figure appears at the top of a short flight of stairs.
- character: OMEGA
  line: I did. I am the one who brought you here.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Who are you?
- character: OMEGA
  line: In the legends of your people I am called Omega.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Omega? But that's impossible. Omega was destroyed.
- character: OMEGA
  line: No, brother Time Lord, I was not destroyed, as you can see. Take the man and
    the girl.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Where are you taking them?
- character: OMEGA
  line: They will not be harmed, Doctor. They have no part in my revenge.
- direction: Gels take Jo and Tyler out.
- character: OMEGA
  line: I have been grievously wronged, Doctor, and now it is time for my vengeance!
- location: Room
- character: TYLER
  line: Well, they won't hold us long in here. Not in a cell without a door.
- character: JO
  line: Look!
- direction: The open doorway becomes a solid piece of wall.
- character: TYLER
  line: It's impossible! It's a real wall.
- character: JO
  line: Really? What kind of a place is this? And who was that creature in the mask?
- character: TYLER
  line: I don't know.
- character: JO
  line: The Doctor seemed to know him.
- character: TYLER
  line: Yes, and whoever it was knew the Doctor, but I wouldn't say they were exactly
    friends.
- character: JO
  line: No, it seemed more like they were deadly enemies.
- location: Throne room
- character: OMEGA
  line: Without me, there would be no time travel. You and our fellow Time Lords would
    still be locked in your own time, as puny as those creatures you now so graciously
    protect.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: You knew your mission was dangerous.
- character: OMEGA
  line: Dangerous, yes, but I completed it, and I did not expect to be abandoned.
    Many thousands of years ago, when I left our planet, all this was then a star
    until I arranged its detonation.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: You were the solar engineer. It was your duty.
- character: OMEGA
  line: It was an honour, or so I thought then. I was to be the one to find and create
    the power source that would give us mastery over time itself.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Well, you succeeded, and are revered for it.
- character: OMEGA
  line: Revered? Here? I was abandoned.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: The histories say that you were lost in the supernova.
- character: OMEGA
  line: I was sacrificed to that supernova. I generated those forces, and for what?
    To be blown out of existence into this black hole of antimatter? My brothers became
    Time Lords, but I was abandoned and forgotten!
- character: DOCTOR
  line: No, not forgotten. All my life I've known of you and honoured you as our greatest
    hero.
- character: OMEGA
  line: A hero? I should have been a god!
- location: Room
- character: JO
  line: Why would the creature bring the Doctor here if they're deadly enemies? Unless
    he means him some terrible harm.
- character: TYLER
  line: Come along, Jo, pull yourself together. No point in getting worried about
    this. We don't know that they're enemies. In any case, I'm sure the Doctor knows
    what he's doing.
- character: JO
  line: I hope you're right.
- location: Throne room
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Well, theoretically, of course, all this is quite impossible.
- character: OMEGA
  line: Here, Doctor, everything is possible. Be seated.
- direction: And an ornate gold chair appears.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Thank you. Tell me, how did you manage to survive?
- character: OMEGA
  line: How does anyone survive? Force of will. Mind, you might say, over antimatter.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: And this organism stuff that you sent to bring us here?
- character: OMEGA
  line: Created from the raw stuff of matter. An organism that can exist in your world
    and mine. It brought you here and imbued you with its properties so that you too
    could exist in both worlds.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: But how do I fit into this picture?
- character: OMEGA
  line: There are some things that even I cannot do, not alone, and at this point
    in my plans I need the help of a brother Time Lord.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Oh, I see.
- character: OMEGA
  line: And it pleases me to use you against them.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: And if I give you my help, do you really think you can defeat the Time Lords?
    All of them?
- character: OMEGA
  line: But I am defeating them, Doctor. All of their power is insufficient to prevent
    the cosmic energy drain which I have caused.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: And if I refuse to cooperate?
- character: OMEGA
  line: Then you will face the wrath of Omega, you and those miserable humans who
    accompany you.
- direction: A communications device beeps. Omega goes over to it and hears a message
    made up of high pitched beeps.
- character: OMEGA
  line: Investigate immediately but do not harm them.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Them?
- character: OMEGA
  line: Well, Doctor, it seems that we have more company.
- location: Tardis
- direction: Patrick, the Brigadier and Benton all land on their feet just after the
    Tardis touches down.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Well, we appear to have arrived.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: (into mike) Corporal Palmer. Come in, Palmer.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: I don't think you'll get through with that thing.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Why not?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: It hasn't quite got the range.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: What are you talking about, Doctor? They're only just outside the building.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Brigadier
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Corporal Palmer, do you read me?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: I think you should prepare yourself for a bit of a shock.
- character: BENTON
  line: Can we take a look outside, Doc?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: We can try.
- direction: The scanner shows the Tardis in the lab.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Well, I never.
- character: BENTON
  line: It seems to have gone, sir.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Yes, well, it looks quiet enough. Right, Doctor, if you'll just open that
    door, I'll see what's going on.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: I really wouldn't advise it.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Oh, come along now, Doctor.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Oh, all right. Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, I do wish you'd listen to me. Come
    along, we'd better follow him.
- location: UNIT Laboratory
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: That's extraordinary. That stuff must have found the Tardis a bit indigestible
    even without the force field on, so it swallowed a bit of the surrounding matter
    as well. Hmm. Rather like taking a pill with a swig of water.
- direction: Patrick has brought a small device with him.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Well, we seem to have got rid of it. Benton, you stay here.
- direction: The Brigadier leaves.
- character: BENTON
  line: So you think we've moved, is that it, Doctor?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Oh, I'm quite sure we have.
- direction: The Brigadier opens an external door and sees the alien world.
- character: BENTON
  line: Well, where do you reckon we are?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Not where he thinks we are.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Now see here, Doctor, You have finally gone too far.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: I rather think we all have. What's it like out there?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: There's, well, there's sand everywhere!
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Oh, splendid. Who's for a swim?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Do you realise what you've done? You've stolen the whole of UNIT HQ. Now what
    am I going to tell Geneva? That the whole blessed building has been picked up
    and put down on some deserted beach? We're probably miles from London!
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: I'm afraid we're a little bit further than that, Brigadier.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: You mean we're not even in the same country? There'll be international repercussions.
    This could be construed as an invasion.
- character: BENTON
  line: It's not just a matter of the same country, sir. If the Doctor's right, we're
    not even in the same universe.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: What? Oh, nonsense, Benton. I tell you that's a beach out there. It's probably
    Norfolk or somewhere like that.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Oh, please, if you'd only listen to me.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Right, now I'll tell you what we'll do. You two stay here. See that nobody
    wanders in. We can't have the place overrun with holiday makers. I'll nip out,
    find a phone and tell the authorities exactly where we are. I'm fairly sure that's
    Cromer. Back in a jiff.
- direction: The Brigadier leaves.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Dear oh dear oh dear.
- character: BENTON
  line: Let's go after him, Doc.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Yes, I suppose we better had. Just a minute. I think I'll have another look
    for my recorder.
- character: BENTON
  line: Doctor, when are you going to face the facts? You've lost your recorder and
    that's that.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Oh, no, I'm sure it's in the Tardis somewhere. I shan't be a minute.
- character: BENTON
  line: Doctor! Look.
- direction: A Gel enters the lab.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Oh my giddy aunt!
- location: Outside the lab
- direction: More Gels hem them in.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Oh!
- character: BENTON
  line: Get back. Back.
- location: Planet surface
- direction: The Brigadier makes his way through the quarry, service pistol at the
    ready.
- character: OLLIS
  line: Hey! Hey, you! Just a minute.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Who are you?
- character: OLLIS
  line: Ollis, game warden.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Ollis? Yes, of course, the chap who found the balloon then vanished. Where
    are we? What's going on here?
- character: OLLIS
  line: I thought you'd have told me that. They're your manoeuvres.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: No, Mister Ollis, I'm as much in the dark as you are. Isn't there anything
    you can tell me?
- character: OLLIS
  line: Well, there were two others in a daffy old motor car for a start. A man and
    a girl. They went off after another fellow and all got took by those lumpy creatures.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: What did the man look like?
- character: OLLIS
  line: Tall, fancy get up, white hair.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: But that's. What happened to them?
- character: OLLIS
  line: I told you! They got took by those things. They didn't get me, though, because
    I'm used to moving quiet, stalking them and that.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: What, did you follow them?
- character: OLLIS
  line: I was just coming to that. Look out!
- direction: They dive for cover and watch as Benton and Patrick are herded along
    by a pair of Gels.
- character: OLLIS
  line: That's them. That's those things. That's what I meant.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: They've got the Doctor and Benton. Come on.
- character: OLLIS
  line: Hold on now. It's no use rushing them. I know where they're bound.
- direction: The Gels make their prisoners turn left towards a massive blue-edged
    opening in a cliff face and take them inside.
- character: OLLIS
  line: Now what, General?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: First we do a recce, then we mount a surprise attack. Mister Ollis, you will
    consider yourself under my orders.
- direction: A pair of massive bronze doors close in the cliff face.
- location: Throne room
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Look, if you cannot reverse the energy drain, the fabric of the entire universe
    could be torn apart.
- character: OMEGA
  line: What if it is? It will make an interesting spectacle.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Then you would be utterly alone forever.
- character: OMEGA
  line: I am used to solitude. And I shall have had my revenge. I shall be satisfied.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Omega, if you would undo the harm that you've done and resume your place on
    the High Council, you could have the freedom to do anything that you wished.
- character: OMEGA
  line: Power is the only freedom that I seek.
- direction: Patrick and Benton are brought in.
- character: OMEGA
  line: Absolute power is absolute freedom. No bargains.
- direction: Benton points at the Jon and gets a kick in the shin to keep quiet.
- character: OMEGA
  line: Especially not with those who betrayed and deserted me. No, Doctor, you are
    here for a reason. Who are you?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Oh, just some more innocent bystanders. Probably scooped up by that bungling
    organism of yours. Send them back, Omega. They can do you no harm.
- character: OMEGA
  line: The organism was programmed to seek out a Time Lord.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: And it has done so.
- character: OMEGA
  line: Can this or this also be a Time Lord?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Appearances aren't everything, you know.
- character: OMEGA
  line: Ah, you do not fear me. Can it be? Two Time Lords? Ha! The same Time Lord!
    The High Council must be desperate indeed to transgress the laws of time.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: I really think you're making a mistake, you know.
- character: OMEGA
  line: You have tried to trick me.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: I was out for a stroll with my friend here when this horrible great jelly
- character: OMEGA
  line: I might have known the High Council would make some such pathetic attempt
    to deceive me.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Now, Omega
- character: OMEGA
  line: Be silent! (thunder roll) While I consider what shall be your fate.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: (sotto) Is it really him? Omega?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: (sotto) Yes, I'm afraid so.
- character: OMEGA
  line: You have angered me. You are facing death! Take them away!
- location: Planet surface
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Did you find a way in?
- character: OLLIS
  line: No. You?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: No. There's only one thing for it.
- character: OLLIS
  line: Eh?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Wait till the door opens then take them by storm. A full scale frontal attack
    using all the resources available.
- character: OLLIS
  line: What does that mean?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: That, Mister Ollis, means you and me. Come on.
- location: Room
- character: DOCTOR
  line: I tell you, I practically had him won over then you turned up and he started
    treating me like an imposter.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Well, you are really, aren't you.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: What do you mean?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Well, I suppose in another way we both are. Or is it neither of us?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Look, for heaven's sake, stop twittering on.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: There's no need to be offensive!
- character: DOCTOR
  line: I'm not being offensive. The important thing is
- character: JO
  line: There they go again.
- character: BENTON
  line: You're supposed to help one another.
- character: JO
  line: That was the idea.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, well, all right, I'm sorry. Perhaps I did speak a trifle sharply.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Yes, well, I'm sorry, too. Well, what did you think of this chap Omega?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Frankly, I thought he was somewhat confused.
- character: TYLER
  line: Yes, and I'm somewhat confused. Who's he?
- character: DOCTORS
  line: Me.
- character: TYLER
  line: I beg your pardon?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Oh, ask Jo, there's a good chap. You see, one minute he was talking about
    destroying everything
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Yes.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: The next minute he's talking about freedom.
- character: TYLER
  line: Look if this is a world of antimatter, how can it all exist?
- character: DOCTORS
  line: The phenomenon of singularity.
- character: TYLER
  line: Singularity?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Look, you explain to him. You're far better at it than I am.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Oh, no, no, please. Older and wiser head.
- character: TYLER
  line: Singularity. Now I know it's supposed to exist
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, well, it does exist. Right here, I'm afraid.
- character: TYLER
  line: But that's just a theory.
- character: JO
  line: Oh look, Doctors, what are you talking about? And simple answers, please.
    One at a time this time.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Well, singularity is a point in space time which can exist only inside a black
    hole. We are in a black hole, in a world of antimatter very close to this point
    of singularity, where all the known physical laws cease to exist. Now, Omega has
    got control of singularity and has learned to use the vast forces locked up inside
    the black hole.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Now, that is how Omega is able to create the world we are now living in by
    a fantastic effort of his will, but unfortunately he thinks he's been wronged
    by the Time Lords.
- character: TYLER
  line: Time Lords?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, and now he's hell bent on revenge.
- character: JO
  line: Well, you'll just have to stop him, won't you.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Well, the trouble is, we're not sure we can.
- character: BENTON
  line: Well, who is this Omega, anyway?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: A Time Lord. One of the greatest of all my race.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Our race.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Our race. Yes, sorry.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Long, long ago, we learnt the secret of time travel, but in order to make
    it a reality we had to have a colossal source of energy.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Omega provided that energy by a fantastic feat of solar engineering. We thought
    he was destroyed, instead of which he finished up here.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Yes, it seems that his imprisonment was the price of our freedom to travel
    in time.
- character: JO
  line: Even so, you can't let him smash everything up. Well, look, he's not all-powerful,
    you know, or else why did he need to bring you here?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, that's true.
- character: BENTON
  line: There must be something you can do to get us out of here?
- character: JO
  line: What about your sonic screwdriver?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: No, that's useless in this world. The only natural law here is the law of
    Omega's will.
- character: JO
  line: Omega's will. Look, if Omega can will up an entire world, well surely you
    two could will up a small door. Well look, you're a Time Lord, aren't you?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes.
- character: JO
  line: In fact, you're two Time Lords. Well, surely your wills combined are a match
    for his? Why else do you think the High Council wanted the two of you here?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: That might work. It just might.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: It's worth a try.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Right.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Right.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Ready?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Ready.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Contact.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Contact.
- direction: The two Doctors concentrate together and the door starts to fade.
- character: JO
  line: It's working.
- direction: A blue old fashioned door with a knob appears.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Well done.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: I couldn't possibly have done it without you. Well, what next?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Now for the singularity chamber. That's the key to it all.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Splendid. Come on.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Come on.
- character: JO
  line: But you
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Jo, you wait there.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: It even opens!
- direction: The two Doctors leave.
- character: TYLER
  line: Singularity chamber. Can't miss that. It's the chance of a lifetime!
- direction: Tyler leaves.
- character: JO
  line: That's charming.
- character: BENTON
  line: I'm not just going to sit here while they have all the fun.
- character: JO
  line: Neither am I. Come on, Sergeant Benton.
- direction: Jo and Benton leave just before the door disappears.
- location: Palace
- direction: The two Doctors hurry through the passages followed by Jo, Tyler and
    Benton. Jo hears something ahead and they look for cover.
- character: BENTON
  line: Through here.
- direction: A Gel glides past.
- location: Throne room
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Well, shall we?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: The bull by the horns, eh?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: All right.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Well, after you.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Let's toss, shall we?
- direction: Patrick tosses the coin and Jon catches it.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: What would be the point?
- location: Singularity room
- direction: Jon leads the way into the next room, where a raised round well with
    steps up to it glows red and has smoke rising from it.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Singularity.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Fascinating.
- character: OMEGA
  line: What! How is it that you two are free?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: By combining our wills against yours.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Together we were able to break down your barriers, so you're not all powerful
    after all, Omega.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: If you free us, we'll plead your cause to the Time Lords. Otherwise we shall
    combine our wills to destroy you.
- character: OMEGA
  line: You dare threaten to destroy me? You wish to fight the will of Omega?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, if I must.
- character: OMEGA
  line: Then you shall, but you will fight the dark side of my mind. The dark side
    of my mind.
- location: Palace
- character: BENTON
  line: It's no good. It all looks the same.
- character: TYLER
  line: Well, we can't just stay here.
- character: JO
  line: They're right behind us.
- character: BENTON
  line: This way. They're everywhere.
- character: TYLER
  line: Let's try down here.
- character: JO
  line: Yes, come on.
- character: BENTON
  line: It's no good, we're lost.
- character: TYLER
  line: Well, we can't just give ourselves up.
- character: BENTON
  line: Agreed. What do we do?
- character: JO
  line: Let's try this way.
- direction: Jo picks up the bunch of conjurers flowers she dropped earlier.
- character: JO
  line: Hey, look what I found.
- character: BENTON
  line: Oh great. Well, how can that help us?
- character: JO
  line: It's the corridor to the main entrance. Come on.
- location: Palace doors
- direction: Benton starts tugging at the doors.
- character: BENTON
  line: Doctor Tyler, give me a hand with this.
- character: JO
  line: Quickly, they're coming!
- direction: The Brigadier and Ollis are on the other side. The doors open.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Out! Make for the hills!
- direction: The Brigadier fires a couple of shots at approaching Gels as everyone
    dashes outside.
- location: Planet surface
- direction: The group run through the quarry, just ahead of the Gel's weapons range
    until they reach shelter.
- character: BENTON
  line: How did you know we were trying to get out?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: We didn't. We were trying to get in. Miss Grant, was the Doctor with you when
    you came here?
- character: JO
  line: Yes, of course, sir.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Well he can't have been. He was with me.
- character: BENTON
  line: Sir, look over there.
- direction: Gels coming down the path.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Come on, it's just over the dune.
- character: JO
  line: What is?
- direction: Meanwhile, Jon and and a personification of Omega's dark side are having
    a slightly slow-motion wrestling match in their heads. They are almost evenly
    matched.
- location: Time Control
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: Energy levels are dangerously low, Doctor. You are our last chance. You must
    go in.
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: The black hole. I repeat, you are our last chance. All three are needed to
    defeat Omega. We will use the last of our energy to send you through.
- location: In the mind
- direction: The mental fight is continuing, and Jon is starting to lose.
- character: OMEGA
  direction: OC
  line: Those who oppose the will of Omega shall not live! Destroy him!
- location: In the mind
- character: DOCTOR 2
  direction: OC
  line: No, Omega! Destroy him and you'll destroy your only chance of freedom.
- location: Singularity room
- direction: Jon is on the floor, gurning as if someone is throttling him. It stops
    and Patrick helps him up.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Thank you, Omega. A most interesting demonstration.
- character: OMEGA
  line: Be warned. You have seen my power. You and your friends will learn that it
    is useless to defy me.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: But our friends do not defy you!
- character: OMEGA
  line: Oh, yes. They too are trying to escape.
- location: Planet surface
- direction: The humans have found Bessie. They all clamber in with the Brigadier
    driving.
- character: JO
  line: Where are we going?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: UNIT HQ.
- character: JO
  line: What?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: It's nearer than you think.
- location: Singularity room
- character: DOCTOR
  line: All this exists because you have willed singularity to create it all for you.
- character: OMEGA
  line: Exactly.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: I say, you mean all you've got to do is think of a thing, rub your magic lamp
    over there and shally me gally me zoop, there it is? That's jolly clever. That's
    jolly clever.
- character: OMEGA
  line: Are you sure that you and he are of the same intelligence?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: You couldn't run me up a quick recorder, could you? It's a little thing about
    this long with holes in. I've lost mine, you see.
- character: OMEGA
  line: I will tell you of the task that lies before you.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: It's not much to ask, a small recorder!
- character: OMEGA
  line: Silence!
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Please, ignore him. Just ignore him. He's incorrigibly frivolous.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Just because you're not musical!
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Please! Will you stop interrupting? Continue.
- character: OMEGA
  line: Continue? (thunder and the palace wobbles) While you play stupid childish
    games? You face annihilation, do you know that? You, your entire race, your precious
    terrestrials, everything, and what do you do? Huh? You wrangle and babble of pipes!
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: It's not a pipe!
- character: DOCTOR
  line: (sotto) What the hell do you think you're trying to do?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: (sotto) Testing the limits of his self control. They're not very good, are
    they.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: (sotto) No. No, they're not, but it'll be dangerous if you push him too far.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: (sotto) We'll have to risk that. That temper is his only weakness.
- character: OMEGA
  line: What are you saying? Do you plot against me?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: No, no. I was just explaining to my associate here that he should show you
    more respect, for both our sakes.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: I am thoroughly repentant. You mentioned some task.
- character: OMEGA
  line: Yes. I created this world through the power of my will. I created the organisms
    which brought you here. This is the source of the light stream you travelled along,
    and I created it. I alone! Omega! And it is not enough. None of it is enough.
    I am still trapped. As trapped as I was the moment I arrived in this, this desolation.
    Huh. Ironic, is it not?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: But surely, if you can transmit matter to Earth down that light stream, you
    could transmit yourself anywhere.
- character: OMEGA
  line: Yes, so I imagined, but no, there was no way out. No escape.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: But why?
- character: OMEGA
  line: So long as I control singularity, I can make it do my will. All these things
    exist because I will them to exist. Without me and the unceasing pressure of my
    will, the work of thousands of years would collapse into chaos in microseconds.
    I am, if you like, the Atlas of my world.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: So, the moment you abandon control, you cannot escape, and you cannot escape
    without abandoning control.
- character: OMEGA
  line: Exactly. I am a prisoner of my own power, my own creation. Or rather, I was,
    until now. And that is your task. To take over my burden so that I may escape.
- direction: Bessie is dodging Gel weapons fire as the two Doctors confer.
- character: OMEGA
  line: Well? Your answer?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: We will obey you, Omega.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: We have no choice.
- character: OMEGA
  line: Then you help me make my preparations. You must first remove this mask. Now
    you, too, will need such masks. The light stream has a slow, corrosive effect,
    due to the acceleration of the particles, but you are in no immediate danger.
    The process takes time. Come, the mask.
- direction: They slowly lift the face plate of the mask. It creaks on its hinge and
    they see the face of Omega.
- character: OMEGA
  line: What is it? Why do you not obey me? Take off the mask.
- direction: Jon pushes the face plate back down.
- character: OMEGA
  line: What are you doing? I am in haste to be gone!
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: We, we cannot remove the mask, Omega, because.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Because beneath that mask there is nothing left of you. The corrosion has
    already done its work.
- character: OMEGA
  line: What?
- direction: Omega goes to a mirror in the wall and removes the mask completely. We
    look straight through him to Jon and Patrick standing behind.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: You exist only because your will insists that you exist. Your will is all
    that is left of you.
- direction: Omega puts the mask back on and doubles over, howling.
- character: OMEGA
  line: It is not true. I am Omega, creator of this world! And I can also destroy!
    Therefore I must exist!
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: But don't you see? You can only exist here!
- character: OMEGA
  line: If I exist only by my will, then my will is to destroy, and all things shall
    be destroyed! All things! All things!
- direction: The palace begins to shake, and the Doctors make their escape.
- location: Palace doors
- character: OMEGA
  direction: OC
  line: All things! All things!
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: I told you he'd got no self control.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Come on, out!
- location: Planet surface
- character: BENTON
  line: Brigadier, mind that rock!
- character: TYLER
  line: Watch out!
- character: OLLIS
  line: Watch it!
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: There it is, over there.
- character: JO
  line: How did it get there?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: A very good question, Miss Grant. Come on!
- direction: Meanwhile, elsewhere.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: That's funny. I could have sworn I left Bessie here.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: You did, old chap. The tracks are leading that way.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: That's Jo and Benton.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: They'll be making for UNIT Headquarters.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: What?
- direction: Bang - the Gels have caught up to them.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Come on! Let's get a move on.
- direction: They run off.
- location: UNIT Laboratory
- direction: Everyone is talking over each other. The Brigadier goes over to the Tardis.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Locked. Typical. Just one moment, if you please! Now wait a moment. We may
    be in a somewhat unusual situation, but you two at least are still supposed to
    be members of UNIT.
- character: JO
  line: Yes, sir.
- character: BENTON
  line: Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: The question is this, what offensive action should we or indeed can we take
    against this chap Omega? Now in the absence of the Doctors it seems to me that
- direction: Boom! Boom!
- character: BENTON
  line: Sir, listen!
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Sounds like a full scale attack.
- character: JO
  line: Maybe they're not firing at us. Maybe
- direction: There is a hammering at the outer door and familiar voices.
- character: JO
  line: It's the Doctors!
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Benton, open the door, quick!
- character: JO
  line: Quickly, come on.
- direction: The Doctors are let in and everyone talks over each other again.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Tardis, everybody! Into the Tardis, quickly!
- character: TYLER
  line: But we can't all get in there!
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Come on, inside. Come on, Brigadier. Inside, inside!
- location: Tardis
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Right, force field on.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Force field's on.
- location: Throne room
- direction: On his monitor, Omega watches his Gels surround the Tardis.
- character: OMEGA
  line: Fools. Do yo think to deny the might of Omega? Soon you will come crawling
    to me for mercy, but by that time, your universe will no longer exist.
- location: Time Control
- direction: The room is almost dark.
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: Well?
- character: TIME LORD
  line: Energy almost completely exhausted, sir.
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: And the latest transference?
- character: TIME LORD
  line: No contact since we tried to pass him through the black hole. The power level
    was so low that he may only be able to observe, advise, not to act.
- location: Tardis
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Well, there you are, then. They can't get in
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: And we can't get out.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: We're besieged.
- character: JO
  line: Oh, great.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: If only I could find my recorder, I could play you a little something to pass
    the time.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: We must be thankful for small mercies.
- character: TYLER
  line: Well, this Tardis of yours is a real marvel, Doctor. I still don't understand
    how we all got inside it, but I don't wish to spend the rest of my life in it.
- character: JO
  line: True. We can't just stay here for ever.
- character: BENTON
  line: Come on, Doc. I mean, with two of you there should be twice as many ideas.
    Well surely you can think up something to nobble this Omega bloke?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Nobble him? You're talking about one of the most powerful blokes in the cosmos.
    Nobble him?
- direction: An alarm sounds.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Well, I. Excuse me. Someone's trying to get through to us.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: You don't think? (points up)
- character: DOCTOR
  line: I hardly think so.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Well, we had to bring them all in here. It wasn't safe outside.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: You're trapped in your own bubble. You can talk.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: On with what?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Ready.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Ready.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Contact.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Contact.
- direction: All three Doctors concentrate.
- direction: The image fades.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: We'd have to strip down the force field.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: But that'd mean leaving the Tardis defenceless.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, I know, but I think we'll have to risk it.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: It's worth a try. Come on!
- direction: The two Doctors start working underneath the console.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: What was all that about, Miss Grant?
- character: JO
  line: Another telepathic conference, I think.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: That old chap?
- character: JO
  line: Afraid so.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Three of them. I didn't know when I was well off. Doctor!
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, what is it?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Would you mind telling us laymen what you scientists are getting so excited
    about?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: We think we've found a way of dealing with Omega.
- character: TYLER
  line: Mind telling me how?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Later, old chap. If there's still time.
- character: TYLER
  line: Oh, splendid.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: How do we know that he'll take the generator? What if he should refuse?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Ah, I've found it.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Found what?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: My recorder. It must have been there all the time.
- direction: The recorder is part of a module in the console stand.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Right in the corner of the force field.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Well, don't touch it.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: I wasn't going to.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Don't you understand? It's exactly what we want. Far better than the force
    field generator.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Oh no, not my recorder!
- character: DOCTOR
  line: I'll get you another one. I'll get you a hundred, I'll get you a thousand
    of them. Come on.
- location: Time control
- character: TIME LORD
  line: I've got a contact, sir.
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: Oh?
- character: TIME LORD
  line: The Doctor.
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: Did you find them? Did you make contact?
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: Is there any chance? We can't hold out much longer. What's happening?
- location: Tardis
- direction: The Doctors remove the module with the recorder wired up in the middle.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Here we are, then. This should do the trick.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: I suppose it would be too much to ask for someone to tell us what all this
    means.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: It means, Brigadier, that we can now strike a bargain with our friend Omega.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: With that box of tricks there?
- character: JO
  line: And a flute?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: This box of tricks, as you call it, is a kind of portable force field.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: And the recorder is considerably more than just a recorder.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes. Right, ready?
- direction: Patrick hands the device to Tyler.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Here, if you'd just hold this.
- character: TYLER
  line: Oh, splendid. Yes.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Right, switch on.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: On.
- direction: Jon goes over to the scanner.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Omega, we want to talk with you.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: We think we have discovered a way to give you back your freedom. Will you
    now free the Tardis so that we can come to you?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: No, not a bit of it, old chap. We just want to avoid a long, tiring walk,
    that's all.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Right. Now listen to me, everybody. From now on you are to do exactly as you
    are told.
- character: JO
  line: Why? What's going to happen?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Now, Jo, please do as I ask. Do exactly as I tell you. Do you promise?
- character: JO
  line: All right, I promise.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Good. Are you ready? Stand by. Here we go.
- direction: Tyler gives Patrick the device back. The Tardis dematerialises from the
    lab.
- location: Singularity room
- direction: Jon leads everyone out of the Tardis.
- character: OMEGA
  line: Do you think this trickery will save you for long?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: We have come to set you free.
- character: OMEGA
  line: What is this?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: On one condition.
- character: OMEGA
  line: I make the terms, Time Lords!
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Omega, if you will send these people back to where they came from, we will
    stay and help you.
- direction: Benton restrains Jo from protesting.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: We think we have devised a way of restoring your freedom to you.
- character: OMEGA
  line: What way? I know now that you cannot give me my freedom, but you can keep
    me company in the endless empty years that lie ahead. If you will both stay here
    willingly and share my exile, then I will spare your friends and their universe.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: We shall give you that promise, Omega. We will not attempt to leave this world
    before you do.
- character: JO
  line: You can't!
- character: OMEGA
  line: Go, then, back to your planet. Be gone, and give thanks that Omega is merciful.
- direction: Omega leaves.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Doctor, what shall we do?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Brigadier, I want all of you to step through that column of smoke.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: What?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Don't be alarmed. It won't harm you. On the contrary, it will take you back
    home.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Please, Brigadier, it's the only way.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Well, I don't know what you're up to, but all right. Now, Mister Ollis?
- character: OLLIS
  line: Not me. I'm not going in there.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Doctor Tyler?
- direction: Tyler walks up the steps to the well.
- character: TYLER
  line: Are you sure it's all right?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, of course I'm sure.
- direction: Tyler steps over the well, and disappears in the smoke from the singularity.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Now then, Mister Ollis.
- direction: Ollis walks through.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Sergeant Benton.
- direction: Benton walks up to the well.
- character: BENTON
  line: I'd sooner Miss Grant.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Move, Benton.
- direction: Benton walks through.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Now then, Miss Grant.
- character: JO
  line: No! No, I want to stay with the Doctor.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Jo, please.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Come on, Jo.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Trust me.
- direction: Jo takes the Brigadier's hand and walks up the steps.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: You'll be all right.
- direction: Jo steps into the smoke.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Goodbye, Doctor. Doctors.
- direction: The Brigadier walks up the steps, turns and salutes then briskly walks
    into the smoke and vanishes.
- character: OMEGA
  line: So, brother Time Lords, I have played your game. Now it is your turn to play
    mine, and there can be no escape for any of us!
- direction: Pat fetches the device from the Tardis.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: You are wrong, Omega. You can have your freedom. It is here.
- character: OMEGA
  line: What is this childish contraption?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: The only freedom you can ever have. Take it. Take it, Omega.
- direction: The two Doctors close their eyes and concentrate. Omega laughs.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Take it!
- character: OMEGA
  line: Commands? You command me? This is my world! I command! And you pester me with
    trinkets!
- direction: Omega knocks the device to the floor.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Run!
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Come on, quick!
- location: Time Control
- direction: The black hole on the monitor disappears as it is replaced by the new
    star, and the lights come back on.
- character: PRESIDENT
  line: Another source of energy. Once again, Omega.
- location: UNIT Laboratory
- direction: Everyone falls out of the air and lands on their feet. The room is back
    in one piece.
- character: BENTON
  line: We're back!
- character: TYLER
  line: Well, we certainly seem to be.
- direction: Benton looks out of the window.
- character: BENTON
  line: But we're really back.
- character: JO
  line: But the Doctors.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Oh, I dare say they'll turn up as usual.
- direction: Jo falls into Benton's arms, sobbing.
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Wonderful chap, both of him.
- direction: A blue police box suddenly appears.
- character: JO
  line: The Tardis!
- character: DOCTOR
  line: I told you he had no self-control, didn't I?
- character: JO
  line: Doctor!
- character: TYLER
  line: How did you manage it?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: By the skin of our teeth.
- character: TYLER
  line: Splendid.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Where's Mister Ollis?
- character: TYLER
  line: What?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Where's Mister Ollis?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Oh, back where he came from, I imagine.
- direction: Ollis lands on his feet by the lake side.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: So there you are. Omega's will was like the tension in the elastic. Once that
    will was broken, all the bits of Earth, UNIT etc just snapped back right into
    their proper place.
- character: BENTON
  line: But how come you turned up in the Tardis?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Because that was the proper place for us.
- character: JO
  line: What was all that business about the flute?
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Well, as you know, it accidentally fell into the force field of the Tardis,
    so that when we were all transformed into antimatter, that was the only thing
    that wasn't processed.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: And when Omega knocked it out of our hands and it fell out of the force field,
    all the atoms and the anti-atoms annihilated one another.
- character: TYLER
  line: So, big bang, and the black hole becomes a supernova!
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Exactly.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Pity, though. I think it had a lovely tone.
- character: DOCTOR 1
  direction: OC
  line: Everything okay?
- location: Tardis
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Well, here we are, back safe and sound.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Quite a party.
- direction: William's picture fades for the last time.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Goodbye. Well, goodbye, everybody. Goodbye. It's been so nice to meet me.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, I see what you mean. I hope I don't meet me again.
- character: DOCTOR 2
  line: Ah.
- direction: Patrick takes a step back, and waves as he disappears.
- character: TYLER
  line: Now I've seen it all.
- character: JO
  line: Pity. He was so sweet.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, wasn't I?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Yes, well, as far as I'm concerned, Doctor, one of you is enough. More than
    enough. Sergeant Benton!
- character: BENTON
  line: Sir?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: You and I'd better make a full inventory of the HQ. Make sure everything's
    back in place. It's all got to be accounted for, you know.
- character: BENTON
  line: Sir?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Yes?
- character: BENTON
  line: Well, excuse me, sir, but, well, if anything is missing, where do we say it's
    gone?
- character: BRIGADIER
  line: Come along, Benton.
- direction: The Brigadier and Benton leave.
- character: TYLER
  line: Well, I think I'd better be on my way, too. Thank you for a fascinating trip,
    Doctor.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Goodbye.
- character: TYLER
  line: Goodbye. Goodbye, Jo.
- character: JO
  line: Goodbye.
- character: TYLER
  line: I don't think I'll write it up in the University journal, not if I want to
    keep my job.
- direction: Tyler leaves.
- character: JO
  line: What's the matter, Doctor? Everything worked out all right, didn't it?
- character: DOCTOR
  line: Yes, for us.
- character: JO
  line: I know what it is. It's because you had to trick Omega.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: I didn't exactly trick him. I promised him his freedom and I gave it to him.
    The only freedom he could ever have.
- character: JO
  line: What else could you do? It was either him or everything.
- direction: There is a materialisation sound, and a caltrop shaped circuit appears
    on the time rotor.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: The Time Lords! Look, they've sent me a new dematerialisation circuit. And
    my knowledge of time travel law and all the dematerialisation codes, they've all
    come back. They've forgiven me. They've given me back my freedom.
- character: JO
  line: I suppose you'll be rushing off, then.
- character: DOCTOR
  line: No, not straight away, Jo. Of course not. I've got to build a new force field
    generator first.
- location: Outside the Lodge
- character: MRS OLLIS
  line: And where do you think you've been, Arthur Ollis? I've been worried sick about
    you, I have. Everybody's been searching. Where have you been? Soldiers looking
    for you. You didn't come home for your dinner. Well?
- character: OLLIS
  line: You'd never believe me, woman. Supper ready?
